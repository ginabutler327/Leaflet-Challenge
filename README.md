# Leaflet-Challenge
Data Bootcamp Week 15 HW - Earthquake Visualization
This challenge was to use Leaflet to create data visualization of earthquakes at various depths. The darker colored markers indicated the lower depths of the earthquakes.  

I struggled with this assignment and used the XpertLearner as well as some of Prof. Booth's example code. I didn't include a heatmap as Prof. Booth did in his example.
